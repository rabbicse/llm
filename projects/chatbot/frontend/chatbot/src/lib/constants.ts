export const CHAT_ID = 'search' as const

export const DUMMY_MESSAGE = `<think>Okay, the user wants a simple HTML login form. Let me break down what I need to do.
First, I'll start with the basic structure of an HTML page. That means opening the html file with the docx CODS syntax and setting up the DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags.
In the head section, I need to include a title and some CSS styling to make it look neat. The form should be centered both vertically and horizontally so it's easy to use on any screen size. I'll use flexbox classes for that.
Now, for the form itself. It should have fields for email, password, remember me, and forgot my password buttons. I'll structure these as input fields and buttons. Oh, and an email and password strength indicator would be nice to show how secure each field is when filled in correctly, but maybe not necessary for a simple form.
Each form group will have a label and an input or button element. Labels should say something clear like "Email" and "Password." The inputs will need validation. I'll make sure the password field isn't longer than 60 characters and requires at least 8 characters. For remember me, maybe add a checkbox, but actually, the default behavior is not secure, so maybe just disable saving if the user enters something wrong. Similarly, for the forgot my password button, it should be disabled when someone types "Forgot" on the first try.
Putting all these together, I'll write the HTML structure with each section properly indented. Then, in the CSS, I'll style everything neatlyâ€”centering, using appropriate fonts, and styling buttons to look clickable.
Finally, I'll test the form to make sure it's functional: saving emails, entering invalid data, and making sure the remember me and forgot my password buttons work correctly. That should cover all bases for a simple yet effective login form.</think>
